Heavenly Father,
I come before You today with a humble heart.

🙏 Forgiveness
Please forgive me for my sins — in thought, word, and deed. Cleanse me from anything that separates me from You. Help me to forgive others as You forgive me.

🙌 Gratitude
Thank You for the gift of life, for breath in my lungs, for strength, and for every blessing seen and unseen. I am grateful for family, friends, opportunities, and even the challenges that shape me.

✨ Guidance
Lord, direct my steps today. Order my thoughts, my actions, and my decisions. Let Your wisdom guide me and keep me from walking in my own understanding.

🛡️ Protection
Surround me, my loved ones, and all connected to me with Your hedge of protection. Keep us safe from harm, evil, and danger. Guard my mind from fear and doubt, and fill me with peace.

💰 Provision
You are my provider, Jehovah Jireh. Meet my needs according to Your riches in glory. Help me to trust You with my finances, my work, my health, and my future.

💡 Strength & Purpose
Give me strength to face challenges with courage, patience to endure trials, and faith to keep believing. Remind me of my purpose, and use me as a vessel to bless others today.

🙇 Surrender
Lord, I surrender my plans, worries, and desires to You. Let Your will be done in my life. Fill me with Your Spirit and let Your love flow through me.

In Jesus' Name I pray,
Amen.`;
